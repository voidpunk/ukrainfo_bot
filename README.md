### A Telegram bot to forward live news to Telegram channels with Telegraph

It continuously scrapes the data from the BBC website (for the English one) and RAI website (for the Italian one), performs some basic check on the articles, upload them entirely on Telegraph, and send well-formatted messages with informative headlines on Telegram including the link to the Telegraph article. No ads, no distraction, pure and quick information checked for you every 30s and immediately delivered to your phone!

Here're the link to 2 channels on Telegram where the bot publishes, they're completely ad-free and for the sake of information, but can go down from time to time if a bug occur and I don't have time to fix it quickly.

Btw, they run on a proud RaspberryPi-2 🤖


### ⚠️ Collaborations needed!

The websites from which information is scraped change really quickly, so continuous maintainance is needed, please help to get people always informed!
